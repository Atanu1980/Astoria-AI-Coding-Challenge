# Astoria-AI-Coding-Challenge
This repository contains the files and the Colab file for the Interview Agent coding challenge. The project uses **LangChain** to leverage the functions necessary to create an Agent and **GPT-4** to extract
information and generate the interview script.

## Try it Now!

âœ¨ To use the notebook you would need to use an OpenAI API key and upload the documents to extract relevant information. You can also use the documents in the folder to test out.
